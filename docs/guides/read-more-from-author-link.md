## How to Enable This Feature

### 1. Use a Custom Domain Email
The easiest way to activate the "Read More from Author" link is to sign up with a **custom domain email** (e.g., `yourname@yourdomain.com`).

Once signed up, you can add links from your domain or its subdomains.

    **Note**: Public email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook are not eligible.

### 2. Set Up Email Forwarding
If you don’t currently have a custom domain email:

- Check with your domain registrar to see if they offer **email forwarding**. This is a simple way to set up a custom email (e.g., `info@yourdomain.com`) and forward it to your existing email address.
- Many registrars provide this service for free or as an affordable add-on.

### 3. Request Manual Approval
If a custom domain email isn’t an option, send us an email at [**hello@moneyeva.com**](mailto:hello@moneyeva.com) and we'll take it from there.


## Why Require a Custom Domain?

We require authors to have a **custom domain** for the **"Read More from Author" link** to maintain trust and quality across our platform. Here’s why:

- **Authenticity**: Custom domains ensure that the external links you provide are genuinely associated with you or your organization, reducing the risk of impersonation or spam.
- **Professionalism**: Links tied to verified custom domains help build credibility and provide users with confidence that the content they’re accessing is reliable.
- **Platform Integrity**: By limiting links to verified domains, we maintain a clean and trustworthy environment for all users.

Even if you don’t have a custom domain email, you’ll need a domain to request manual approval. If you don’t have one, we recommend registering a domain and setting up email forwarding to streamline the process.
