### 6. How is my data stored and protected?

At Money Eva, keeping things simple means keeping your data private. We don’t store your name—just your email to identify your account. Login is password-free, using magic links or Sign in with Google for convenience and security.

Other users can only see your screen name (which you pick at first login) and an avatar image. The app automatically checks Gravatar using your email, so if you’ve set up a Gravatar, it will appear—otherwise, no avatar is shown. Your email address always stays private.

Your financial exploration stays yours, and we’re here to keep it that way.

Your work will be discoverable under your screen name. Check out our [Creating Your Own](../guides/creating-your-own.md) page to get started.

### 8. Is Money Eva relevant to my country?

Yes! Money Eva’s core concepts—like timing and compounding—are universal and apply to key pillars of the global economy, including inflation, investments, and debt management.

While specific rules vary by country and jurisdiction (and can change with government policies), the fundamental principles are similar. Money Eva is designed to handle essential use cases—like tiered tax rates, bracket limits, and cost basis calculations for capital gains—with simplicity and ease. For more complex cases or those with minimal impact, we’ve intentionally kept things streamlined.

In today’s globalized economy, investments like ETFs often track multiple developed and emerging markets, operating alongside broader trends of normalization across countries. Wherever you’re from, Money Eva is built to help you explore and understand financial decisions.

---

### 9. Does Money Eva provide financial advice?

No, Money Eva doesn’t provide financial advice. Instead, it’s a platform for exploring financial scenarios and understanding how your decisions might play out over time.

Personal decisions often involve factors like diversification, cash flow health, the effort required to manage assets, life goals, and personal circumstances. Money Eva helps you uncover and quantify these aspects, giving you a clearer picture of your options.

However, no program can truly know *you*. While Money Eva provides tools for insight and clarity, the decisions remain yours. For personalized advice, we recommend consulting a licensed financial professional.

### 10. Can I share my scenarios with others?

Yes! Sharing is a core part of the Money Eva experience. Once you’ve created or tailored a scenario, you can publish it for others to discover under your screen name. Sharing helps the community learn from different perspectives and approaches.

Additionally, you can easily share links to your scenarios with friends, family, or collaborators, even if they don’t have a Money Eva account. It’s a great way to explore financial decisions together.
