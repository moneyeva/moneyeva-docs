## Kickstarting the Tips
As we’re just starting out, here are some suggestions from the Money Eva team and early explorers:

### 1. Use Scenarios as Templates
Don’t start from scratch! Browse community scenarios to find ones close to your needs, then tailor them to match your situation. It’s a fast way to get insights.

### 2. Try Landscape Mode on Mobile
Switch your phone to landscape mode to unlock the desktop-style two-column view for a smoother experience.

---

### 3. Publish Your Insights
Got a unique perspective? Customize a scenario or create your own from scratch and publish it for others to learn from—it’s a great way to contribute to the community.

### 4. Dig Into Calculations with the Number Revealer
Use the **“123” button** to break down calculations step-by-step and explore changes year by year. This helps you fully understand how your inputs shape the results over time.
