# Saving & Sharing

Money Eva allows you to save your inputs for quick access and revisit them later. While you can save customized inputs for your own use, sharing an Eva always loads the author's original numbers as the starting point.

## Saving Your Inputs

When viewing an Eva, logged-in users can save their inputs to one of **five memory slots**. These slots allow you to quickly recall specific input combinations, making it easy to experiment with different setups or revisit past calculations.

### How to Save
1. Click the **Heart** button to open the save options.
2. Select an **empty memory slot** or overwrite an existing one.
3. Enter a short, descriptive name to identify your saved inputs.
4. Your inputs will now be stored and accessible anytime from the **Folder floating icon button**.

### Managing Saves
From the **Folder floating icon button**, you can:

- **Reload Author's Numbers**: Reset the Eva to its original inputs as designed by the author.
- **Access Saved Slots**: Click on any of your saved memory slots to instantly load your previously saved inputs.
- **Save Current Screen Content**: Save your current inputs to a memory slot.
- **Save / Manage My Saves**: Manage your memory slots, including renaming or overwriting saved inputs.

## Sharing an Eva

While you can save and customize inputs for personal use, saved memory slots are private and cannot be shared with others. If you share the URL of an Eva, it will always load with the author's original numbers as the default showcase. 

This ensures that every shared Eva remains consistent with the author's intended setup, while still allowing others to tailor it to their own needs after loading.

Saving and sharing in Money Eva give you the flexibility to work with scenarios in a way that suits your needs, while keeping the original design intact for others to explore.
