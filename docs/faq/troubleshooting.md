# Troubleshooting

Having trouble using Money Eva? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered! This page addresses common issues and provides solutions to help you get back on track quickly.

---

## **I can’t log in or access my account.**
- Make sure you’re using the correct email address linked to your account.
- If you’re logging in with a login link:
    - Check your email inbox (and spam folder) for the login email.
    - The link is one-time use, so make sure to click it directly from your email.
    - Be aware that some email apps (like iOS Mail) may preview the link, which can make it invalid. If that happens, request a new link.
    - To ensure you receive login emails, whitelist **no-reply@moneyeva.com**.
- For Google sign-in, ensure your browser is logged into the correct Google account.

## **My edits aren’t saving.**
- Check the yellow status bar at the top of the screen—if it turns red, an error message will appear at the bottom. Address the issue and continue making edits to resolve it.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection; Money Eva needs it to auto-save your edits.
- Avoid having multiple edit windows open for the same work-in-progress, even across devices. They might overwrite each other. Keep only one window open for edits.
- If the problem persists, try refreshing the page, clearing your browser cache, and logging in again.

## **I see unexpected results in my scenario.**
- Double-check your inputs—tiny changes can make a big difference in financial models.
- Use the **Number Revealer** (via the "123" button) and **Symbol Popups** (via the "?" buttons) to dig deeper into the calculations and identify potential errors.
- Explore similar scenarios in the community to compare different approaches.

---

## **Something isn’t displaying correctly on my screen.**
- For mobile users, try switching to landscape mode for an optimized view.
- Ensure your browser is up to date; Money Eva works best on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, or Edge.
- Resize your browser window if elements appear misaligned on a desktop.
