# Creating Your Own

Creating your own scenario, or “Eva,” in Money Eva allows you to tailor every detail to your specific financial questions. Whether you’re starting from scratch or building on an existing scenario, the process is designed to be intuitive and flexible.

## 1. Start Drafting Your Eva

You can begin drafting your Eva in two ways:

- **By Tailoring an Existing Scenario**:  
     - On any published Eva, click the **":material-pencil: Tailor It to Your Needs"** button (or the floating gold pencil button). This opens the scenarios for editing, allowing you to edit all calculation steps, inputs, and equations.
- **From Scratch**:  
     - Go to any search result page and click on the **":material-pencil: Create Yours From Scratch"** button at the bottom.  
     - Alternatively, navigate to **Avatar > My Evas** and click on **":material-plus: Create a New Eva"**.

!!! warning
    If you’re not logged in, you can still explore and draft changes, but your edits cannot be saved. To save your progress, log in or sign up before you begin drafting.


Once in drafting mode, you can customize every aspect of your Eva to suit your needs. Money Eva supports:

- **Country and Currency**: Click the **Pencil button :material-pencil:** in the country badge to update the intended country and currency for your Eva.
- **Inputs and Steps**: Add, edit, or remove inputs and calculation steps. Organize them logically and label them clearly.
- **Equations**: Modify the underlying math to fit your scenario’s requirements. Adjust equations, link inputs to calculations, or add new variables to refine your results.

## 2. Save as a Work-In-Progress

Once you’re ready to save your Eva as a work-in-progress, you’ll need to provide a **Permanent Link**. This unique identifier will make your Eva accessible under your screen name (e.g., `moneyeva.com/u/[your-screen-name]/[your-permanent-link]`) after it’s published.

### Auto-Save

After saving, your Eva will be auto-saved as you make further changes, ensuring your progress is never lost. You can leave the work-in-progress at any time and return later to pick up right where you left off.

### Access Your Work-In-Progress

Your saved work-in-progress Evas are available in the **Avatar > My Evas** page. From there, you can:

- Continue editing.
- View your list of published Evas.
- Create new Evas.

### Editing the Permanent Link

If you need to update the Permanent Link for your Eva, you can do so at any point before publishing. This allows you to refine the link to better reflect the scenario’s purpose or make it easier to share.


!!! warning
    Once an Eva is published, it cannot be unpublished. If you're updating an Eva and decide to edit its Permanent Link, the changes will be published as a new Eva with the updated URL. The original Eva will remain accessible at its previous URL and will not be altered. Be mindful of this when making updates to avoid creating multiple versions unintentionally.


Saving your Eva as a work-in-progress gives you the flexibility to refine it over time, ensuring it’s fully polished before you share it with others.

## 3. Publish

When your Eva is complete and ready to share, click the **Right Arrow button :material-arrow-right:** to preview it. The system will validate your scenario to ensure all required fields are filled and that it’s ready for public use.

### Important Details

- Add a **Descriptive Title**: Help users understand what your Eva is about.
- Write **Intro Words**: Provide context or purpose for your Eva.
- Fill in the **Chart Description**: Explain “what to look for in this chart” to guide users in understanding the visuals.

If the preview looks good, click the **Checkmark button :material-check:** to publish your Eva.

Once published:

- Your Eva will be publicly accessible under your screen name and permanent link.
- Published Evas **cannot be unpublished**, but you can update them at any time to make improvements or corrections.
